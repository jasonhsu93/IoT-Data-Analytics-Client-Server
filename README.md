Developed a scalable IoT analytics server that receives sensor data and sends notifications. Utilized the client-server model and multithreading techniques which prioritized incoming requests and messages to optimize the response time, creating a server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously. Worked in a team of three and integrated a JUnit testing system of 95% branch coverage to verify the stability.
